This Python script demonstrates a basic voice assistant named "Warner." It utilizes various libraries and APIs to perform tasks based on voice commands. Here's a shorter description:

The script initializes a voice recognition system using the SpeechRecognition library and converts voice input into text. It also uses pyttsx3 for text-to-speech functionality.

The assistant can perform several actions based on voice commands, including:

Opening Notepad or Command Prompt
Opening the webcam and displaying live video
Playing random music from a specified directory
Retrieving the user's IP address
Searching and providing summaries from Wikipedia
Upon running the script, the assistant greets the user based on the current time and asks for commands. It listens for user input, recognizes the command, and executes the corresponding action.

Overall, this script serves as a foundation for a basic voice assistant and can be expanded upon to add more features and functionality.
